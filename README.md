• Can change password

In this project the “Receptionist” has the following features:
• Can do login

• Can change password

# Tools Used:
To develop this project we have used the following:
• XAMPP
• Notepad++
• SublimeText
• JVM

# OOP and Java Concepts Used:
• Encapsulation: This is a mechanism of binding one attribute with a method which is done to prevent direct access to the attributes. In our project it is done by using different access modifiers.
• Abstraction: An abstract class can extend only one class at a time. In our project we have used abstract class. All the interfaces are abstract class.
• Inheritance: This is the mechanism of creating a new class from an existing class.
• Polymorphism: This can be done in four ways. In our project we have done it by method overriding. We override all the methods of interfaces classes in their repository classes.
• Association: In our project almost in every class this is used.

# Impact of this Project:
Our project will help the employees to do all of their job easily. Beacause by using this, most of the manual works can be managed. Manager can easily manage employees, rooms and customers. Receptionist can manage rooms and customers. Without manager and receptionist other employees only can log in in the system and change their password.

# Limitations and Possible Future Improvements:
Due to lack of time, one exception cannot be handled which is a NumberFormatException. Also there are a lot of features that we have not added for the same reason. But we will add those features in future.
